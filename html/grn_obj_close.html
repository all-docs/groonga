 * \brief Close an object.
 *
 *        This function frees all resources used by the specified object (`obj`)
 *        from memory. All resources include other associated objects.
 *
 *        In general, you must close temporary objects explicitly. You don't
 *        need to close persistent objects explicitly because you can close
 *        persistent objects implicitly by closing a DB object.
 *
 *        You can use \ref grn_obj_unlink instead. It closes temporary objects
 *        but does nothing for most persistent objects. It's useful for normal
 *        use cases.
 *
 * \attention In general, you should not close persistent objects such as tables
 *            and columns for performance reasons. If you close persistent
 *            objects, you need to re-open them when they are needed again. This
 *            is inefficient.
 *
 * \param ctx The context object.
 * \param obj The object to be closed.
 *
 * \return \ref GRN_SUCCESS on success, the appropriate \ref grn_rc on error.
